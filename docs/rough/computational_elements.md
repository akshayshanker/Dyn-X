# 4. Computational Elements

## 4.1 Fundamental Computational Building Blocks

ModCraft implements the computational graph structure using the following core elements:

1. **Continuation Elements**:
   - Implement expected value calculations by integrating over uncertain outcomes
   - Support various types of uncertainty distributions (normal, discrete, custom)
   - Handle various methods of numerical integration (quadrature, Monte Carlo)

2. **Arrival Elements**:
   - Implement state transformations based on arriving information
   - Map incoming states and shocks to updated states
   - Support both structural and reduced-form update mechanisms

3. **Decision Elements**:
   - Implement optimization algorithms appropriate to the problem structure
   - Support discrete choice, continuous choice, and hybrid choice spaces
   - Provide both exact and approximate optimization methods

## 4.2 Specialized Economic Components

Building on the fundamental elements, ModCraft provides specialized components for common economic structures:

1. **Production Components**:
   - Various production functions (Cobb-Douglas, CES, etc.)
   - Investment mechanisms with adjustment costs
   - Resource constraint handling

2. **Preference Components**:
   - Utility functions (CRRA, CARA, etc.)
   - Preference shocks and taste heterogeneity
   - Temporal preference structures (hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic)

3. **Market Components**:
   - Price formation mechanisms
   - Market clearing conditions
   - Trading frictions and search mechanisms

4. **Policy Components**:
   - Tax structures and fiscal policies
   - Monetary policy rules
   - Regulatory constraints

## 4.3 Advanced Computational Features

ModCraft's computational elements are enhanced with features that facilitate advanced modeling:

1. **Automatic Differentiation**:
   - Forward and reverse mode differentiation for optimization
   - Gradient-based solution methods
   - Efficient sensitivity analysis

2. **Parallelization**:
   - Distributing independent computations across cores or devices
   - Batch processing of similar calculations
   - GPU acceleration of numerically intensive operations

3. **Adaptivity**:
   - Dynamic refinement of grids or approximation spaces
   - Error-controlled numerical methods
   - Automatic selection of appropriate solution techniques

4. **Numerical Robustness**:
   - Handling of corner cases and singularities
   - Numerical stability enhancements
   - Built-in diagnostics and validation checks

These computational elements provide the machinery needed to implement the mathematical and economic concepts captured in the ModCraft graph structure, enabling efficient solution of complex dynamic economic models.

## 4.4 Implementation Classes

### 4.4.1 Stage Class

The Stage class is a core container that:
- Manages perches and movers in a circuit board pattern
- Follows the CDC (Continuation, Decision, Arrival) paradigm
- Provides interfaces for solving and simulating

A stage can be in several states:
- initialized: has mathematical specification
- parameterized: has parameter values configured
- methodized: has solution methods configured
- solvable: has all required perches and is ready to be solved
- solved: has been solved with value functions and decision rules
- simulated: has been simulated with decision paths

### 4.4.2 Perch Class

Perches represent points in the state space where computational objects are stored:
- **Arrival Perch**: State at which a shock is realized
- **Decision Perch**: State at which a decision is made
- **Continuation Perch**: State after decision but before next shock

Each perch contains:
- Mathematical specifications (state space, functions)
- Parameter values
- Method configurations
- Computational results (value functions, decision rules)
- Simulation results (distributions, statistics)

### 4.4.3 Mover Class

Movers connect perches and represent transitions between states:
- Define forward transitions for simulation
- Contain backward operators for solving
- Manage constraints and shock processes

Key mover types include:
- **ArrivalToDecisionMover**: Transitions from arrival to decision state
- **DecisionToContinuationMover**: Transitions from decision to continuation state
- **ContinuationToArrivalMover**: Transitions from continuation to arrival state (possibly in the next period)

### 4.4.4 Heptapod Plugin

The Heptapod plugin provides model representation functionality:
- Separates symbolic model definitions (math) from computational implementations
- Manages the translation between mathematical concepts and their numerical representations
- Facilitates the modular structure of the framework
