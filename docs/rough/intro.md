The ModCraft framework is built on a theoretical foundation that instantiates the standard dynamic programming framework in a way that disaggregates computation of recursive optimization problems into stand-alone `stages` which process the smallest possible independent information sets. Each stage is associated with a common `problem representation`. Stages are can be connected together to form a `model circuit` that represents the entire complete recursive problem.
